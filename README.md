# Styfi

Styfi is a next-generation fashion marketplace mobile application built with Flutter. It integrates advanced AI features—such as virtual try-ons, trend detection, and outfit composition—directly into the shopping experience, bridging the gap between e-commerce and personal styling.

The app serves two distinct user roles: Buyers, who discover and try products virtually, and Sellers, who manage inventory and leverage AI to enhance product listings.

## Features

### For Buyers
- Virtual Try-On: Upload a personal photo and select a product to visualize how it looks on you using AI-powered image synthesis.
- Outfit Composer: Select a product and receive AI-generated recommendations for matching items to create a complete look (including prices and color coordination).
- Trend Detector: Search for fashion categories (e.g., "Summer Dresses") to discover real-time trends, popularity scores, and key fashion keywords.
- Marketplace: Browse the "Latest Drops" in a visual grid layout and view detailed product information.
- Seamless Checkout: Integrated flow for purchasing products directly within the app.

### For Sellers
- Seller Dashboard: A dedicated interface to manage product listings and view incoming orders.
- Image Enhancer: Upload raw product photos and use AI to automatically enhance quality, lighting, and appeal before listing.
- Order Management: Track order status and sales performance.

### Core System
- Dual Role System: Users can switch between "Buyer" and "Seller" roles, with tailored interfaces for each.
- Secure Authentication: Powered by Firebase Authentication for secure sign-up and login.
- Real-time Database: Utilizes Cloud Firestore for instant updates on products, orders, and user profiles.
- Cloud Storage: Uses Supabase for efficient and scalable storage of product images.
